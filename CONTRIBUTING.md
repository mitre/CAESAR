# Contributing to Bayanat

We appreciate all contributions to Bayanat no matter how small! Here are the current guidelines.

## New features

Unfortunately at this time, we're unable to accept contributions that adds a new feature to Bayanat. This is due to our current limited capacity. Adding a new code to Bayanat will require us to review the code thoroughly, especially to ensure the Bayanat's security isn't affected.

To that end we decided to reject any new change until further notice. We're working on expanding our capacity and we're hoping we can allow contributions that contain new features in the near future.

## Bug fixes

If you spotted a bug in Bayanat and would like to submit a fix, please first report the bug on GitHub. You can indicate in your report that you're going to submit a fix. We will need to be able to verify and reproduce the bug before accepting any fix.

## Submitting a contribution

You will need to open a new PR. We require an individual PR for each bug fix or new feature. PRs that combine multiple issues will be rejected. 

We'll add more guidelines very soon regarding formatting and documentation.
