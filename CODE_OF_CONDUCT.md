# Bayanat Code of Conduct

The following are the rules we ask contributors to Bayanat to understand and abide by:

- Be professional and treat others with respect.
- Personal attacks, discrimination, harassment, threats and derogatory language will not be tolerated. 
- Avoid discussions in topics not related to Bayanat's development (e.g. politics, religion, etc...).

## Reporting

Please report conduct contrary to this code to tech at syriaaccountability dot org. Reports will be investigated confidentially by SJAC staff. 

Actions taken against unacceptable behaviour can range from a warning to a ban from contributing to Bayanat, depending on the seriousness of the behaviour.

## Thanks

Some ideas in the document were inspired by Ubuntu and Arch Linux Codes of Conduct.
